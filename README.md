# just refreshing my skills using c++ (problem solving) soon I will apply these skills in real world project.

what I code here Is bulding my own 
string library 
date --
input & validate-- 
util--
I know all of these are already built-in functions in the language, but I find them perfect for practice and revising the basics. As I mentioned, I will apply these concepts or coding patterns to solve real-world problems using any programming language.
